# Manual Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression Classifiers

This project implements two machine learning classifiers from scratch: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The classifiers are tested on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the inner workings of two popular machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch:
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression Classifier

The project also includes data preprocessing steps to prepare the IMDB dataset for training and testing the classifiers.


## Usage

### Training and Testing the Models

Run the main script to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance:

```sh
python main.py
```

### Predicting Sentiment

You can use the trained models to predict the sentiment of custom movie reviews:

```sh
python predict.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter a movie review, and the script will output the predicted sentiment.

## Implementation Details

### Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class. This implementation uses Gaussian Naive Bayes, where the likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian.

#### Key Methods

- `fit(X, y)`: Fits the model to the training data.
- `predict(X)`: Predicts the class labels for the given input samples.
- `_predict(x)`: Computes the posterior probability for each class and returns the class with the highest probability.
- `_pdf(class_idx, x)`: Computes the probability density function for the given class and sample.

### Logistic Regression Classifier

The Logistic Regression classifier models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class using the logistic function.

#### Key Methods

- `fit(X, y)`: Fits the model to the training data using gradient descent.
- `predict(X)`: Predicts the class labels for the given input samples.
- `_sigmoid(x)`: Computes the sigmoid function for the given input.

## Results

After training the models on the IMDB dataset, their performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports. The results are displayed in the console output.
